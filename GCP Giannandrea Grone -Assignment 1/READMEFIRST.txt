1) The project uses FREEGLUT and GLEW. I added the SDKs just in case

2) To open the project use GCPassignment.sln (i renamed it from "shaders", bad idea)

2) the solution sometimes gives a lot of warnings, close all the editing "windows" and rebuild the project should be ok now. (always because the renaming)

3) when you start the .exe also the console opens and there you can check the controls to move around the camera and toggle Quaternions/matrices or to toggle automatic/manual 

4)I intially opened the project with visual studio 2010, but I have been using 2013 to edit it (so it might a better idea to open it with 2013)

5) it needs 2 dlls glew32.dll and freglut.dll (both are included).
